Compiling FlashForth 5
----------------------

FlashForth 5 (FF) can be compiled
with the USB support and without.

FF can be compiled for installation with a device programmer (e.g. PicKit2/3/4).

The common configuration parameters are in p18f-main.inc.
The device configuration bits and the USB definitions are in the
device specific configuration files.

Use MPLABX v5.50 and XC8 PIC-AS v.2.32 or later.

Define a project with one source file 'ff-pic18.S'.
Select a chip, pic-as and a device programmer.
Update p18f-main.inc and device include file with your parameters.
For some chips the peripheral pin selections for the UARTs 
must be defined according to your hardware design.

Note the assembler additional parameters that must be defined
according to the instructions in the include files.

The USB VID and PID and the INF file provided with FlashForth
are purely for test purposes and for personal use.
These can be changed in the ff-usbcdc.S file.
